# Optimal stopping of a Brownian bridge with a random pinning point
Manuel Emilio Baliño Vilar TFM Repository

This thesis focuses the Optimal Stopping Problems (OSP) for a Brownian bridge with a random pinning point. The work builds on prior contributions (notably Ekström and Vaicenavicius, 2020), and develops a numerical algorithm based on Monte Carlo simulations to compute optimal stopping boundaries for Brownian bridges ending in a random point whose distribution is a mixture of Gaussians or degenerated distributions. 

Efficiency analyses and empirical tests against known cases confirm the algorithm’s accuracy and performance. Real-world relevance is demonstrated by an application to IBM options pricing.

By combining theoretical rigor with computational experimentation, this thesis advances the toolkit for tackling optimal stopping problems, especially when analytical solutions are difficult to achieve. Finally, limitations and avenues for future research are discussed.
